# thesis_experiments

This is a repository for the experiments performed during my Diploma thesis, which consisted in creating a software tool for the automation of machine learning tasks. The experiments aim at:

* training HyperParameterPrediction (HPP) models
* assessing Automated Data Scientist (ADS), the software tool I developed during my thesis
* gathering all data files necessary

In particular, file:

* **baseline_methods** contains code and data for the baseline methods, used to compare the performance of my tool with
* **data**  contains the classification datasets I've gathered, as well as the data produced by model tuning, in order to create the classes for the HPP models   
* **HPP_train** contains all experiments for training the HPP models
* **readiness_metrics** contains experiments for calculating the readiness of ADS for particular datasets
* **system_evaluation** evaluates ADS as a whole, as well as the forward model selection ensemble
